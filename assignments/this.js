/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/Global Object Binding: The value of this, will be the window/console Object when in the global scope.
* 2. Implicit Binding: If a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before the dot is this.
* 3. New binding: If a constructor function is used, then this refers to a specific instance of the object that is created and returned by said function.
* 4. Explicit binding: the apply or call method is used, then this is explicity defined.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
